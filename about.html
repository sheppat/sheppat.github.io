          <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Nicholas</strong>, a 16-year-old Roblox enthusiast, developer, and creator based in Oshawa, Canada. My passion is building tools, games, and utilities to make Roblox fun, engaging, and safe for everyone.</p>
          
          <p>My journey began with curiosity about how Roblox works and how games are designed. Over time, I’ve learned <strong>JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Firebase integration</strong> to create reliable tools that provide stats, analytics, and enhanced gameplay experiences.</p>
          
          <p>UsefulUtilities is my platform to share these creations with the Roblox community. Each tool and game is designed with <strong>privacy, safety, and usability</strong> in mind. Players can track stats, explore games, and access tools without sharing personal information.</p>

          <p><strong>Mission Statement:</strong> <em>Our mission is to help Roblox players have fun, learn, and grow through safe, easy-to-use tools and games. We focus on innovation, community engagement, and educational gaming experiences.</em></p>

          <p>At UsefulUtilities, we believe in:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Creating safe and enjoyable experiences for Roblox players of all ages.</li>
            <li>Building tools that provide real value, insights, and entertainment.</li>
            <li>Listening to the community and improving continuously.</li>
            <li>Maintaining user privacy and data security as a top priority.</li>
          </ul>
